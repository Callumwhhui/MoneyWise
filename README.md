Our project has crossed the finish line! As a team, we've checked off all the boxes: MVP is in place, along with mobile responsiveness, dark mode, authentication, dynamic graphs, and seamless CRUD operations. Our collaboration has been a driving force behind our success!

## Key Learnings

Our journey with MoneyWise has been an incredible learning experience, encompassing both technical and collaborative aspects. As we developed this full-stack CRUD web app, we gained valuable insights that have expanded our skill sets and enriched our teamwork. Here are some key learnings from our MoneyWise adventure:

1. **Collaboration is Key**: Building a complex project like MoneyWise required seamless collaboration between backend and frontend developers. Regular communication, code reviews, and addressing challenges as a team greatly contributed to our success.

2. **Dynamic Graphs**: The integration of Charts.js allowed us to present data dynamically with interactive graphs. This taught us how to visualise complex data sets and present them in an easily digestible format.

3. **Version Control**: Utilising Git and GitHub throughout the project underscored the importance of version control in collaborative development, enabling efficient code management and tracking changes.

## The Brief 

☐ Be a full-stack Django application.

☐ Connect to and perform data operations on a PostgreSQL database (the default SQLLite3 database is not acceptable).

☐ If consuming an API (OPTIONAL), have at least one data entity (Model) in addition to the built-in User model. The related entity can be either a one-to-many (1:M) or a many-to-many (M:M) relationship.

☐ If not consuming an API, have at least two data entities (Models) in addition to the built-in User model. It is preferable to have at least one one-to-many (1:M) and one many-to-many (M:M) relationship between entities/models.

☐ Have full-CRUD data operations across any combination of the app's models (excluding the User model). For example, creating/reading/updating posts and creating/deleting comments qualifies as full-CRUD data operations.

☐ Authenticate users using Django's built-in authentication.

☐ Implement authorization by restricting access to the Creation, Updating & Deletion of data resources using the login_required decorator in the case of view functions; or, in the case of class-based views, inheriting from the LoginRequiredMixin class.

☐ Be deployed online using Heroku. Presentations must use the deployed application.

The app may optionally:
☐ Upload images to AWS S3

☐ Consume an API (installation of the Requests package will be necessary)
